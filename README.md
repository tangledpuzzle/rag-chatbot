## Introduction

This project combines the power
of [Lama.cpp](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) (only used for document chunking and querying the Vector Database, and we plan to
eliminate it entirely), [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) and [Streamlit](https://discuss.streamlit.io/) to build:

* a Conversation-aware Chatbot (ChatGPT like experience).
* a RAG (Retrieval-augmented generation) ChatBot.

The RAG Chatbot works by taking a collection of Markdown files as input and, when asked a question, provides the
corresponding answer
based on the context provided by those files.

![rag-chatbot-architecture-1.png](images/rag-chatbot-architecture-1.png)

The `Memory Builder` component of the project loads Markdown pages from the `docs` folder.
It then divides these pages into smaller sections, calculates the embeddings (a numerical representation) of these
sections with the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
`sentence-transformer`, and saves them in an embedding database called [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
for later use.

When a user asks a question, the RAG ChatBot retrieves the most relevant sections from the Embedding database.
Since the original question can't be always optimal to retrieve for the LLM, we first prompt an LLM to rewrite the
question, then conduct retrieval-augmented reading.
The most relevant sections are then used as context to generate the final answer using a local language model (LLM).
Additionally, the chatbot is designed to remember previous interactions. It saves the chat history and considers the
relevant context from previous conversations to provide more accurate answers.

To deal with context overflows, we implemented three approaches:

* `Create And Refine the Context`: synthesize a responses sequentially through all retrieved contents.
    * ![create-and-refine-the-context.png](images/create-and-refine-the-context.png)
* `Hierarchical Summarization of Context`: generate an answer for each relevant section independently, and then
  hierarchically combine the answers.
    * ![hierarchical-summarization.png](images/hierarchical-summarization.png)
* `Async Hierarchical Summarization of Context`: parallelized version of the Hierarchical Summarization of Context which
  lead to big speedups in response synthesis.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* GPU supporting CUDA 12.1+
* Poetry 1.7.0

### Install Poetry

Install Poetry with the official installer by following
this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

You must use the current adopted version of Poetry
defined [here](https://github.com/umbertogriffo/rag-chatbot/blob/main/version/poetry).

If you have poetry already installed and is not the right version, you can downgrade (or upgrade) poetry through:

```
poetry self update <version>
```

## Bootstrap Environment

To easily install the dependencies we created a make file.

### How to use the make file

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `Setup` as your init command (or after `Clean`).

* Check: ```make check```
    * Use it to check that `which pip3` and `which python3` points to the right path.
* Setup:
    * Setup with NVIDIA CUDA acceleration: ```make setup_cuda```
        * Creates an environment and installs all dependencies with NVIDIA CUDA acceleration.
    * Setup with Metal GPU acceleration: ```make setup_metal```
        * Creates an environment and installs all dependencies with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS system only.
* Update: ```make update```
    * Update an environment and installs all updated dependencies.
* Tidy up the code: ```make tidy```
    * Run Ruff check and format.
* Clean: ```make clean```
    * Removes the environment and all cached files.
* Test: ```make test```
    * Runs all tests.
    * Using [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)

## Using the Open-Source Models Locally

We utilize the open-source library [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a binding for [llama-cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp),
allowing us to utilize it within a Python environment.
`llama-cpp` serves as a C++ backend designed to work efficiently with transformer-based models.
Running the LLMs architecture on a local PC is impossible due to the large (~7 billion) number of parameters.
This library enable us to run them either on a `CPU` or `GPU`.
Additionally, we use the `Quantization and 4-bit precision` to reduce number of bits required to represent the numbers.
The quantized models are stored in [GGML/GGUF](https://medium.com/@phillipgimmi/what-is-gguf-and-ggml-e364834d241c) format.
