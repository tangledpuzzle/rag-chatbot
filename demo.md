## Writing docstring

Add the docstring in Google format to the following Python function:
```
def delete_folders_older_than_x_days(path: Path, days: int):
    """
    Deletes folders older than x days in the given directory.

    Args:
        path (Path): The directory to search within.
        days (int): The number of days to consider a folder as old.

    """

    current_time = time.time()
    seconds_in_a_day = 24 * 60 * 60

    for folder in path.iterdir():
        if folder.is_dir():
            # `mtime` stands for `modification time`. It is the timestamp of the last time the contents of a file or directory were modified.
            if folder.stat().st_mtime < (current_time - (days * seconds_in_a_day)):
                logger.warning(f"Deleting {folder} that is older than {days} days ")
                shutil.rmtree(folder)
```

## Write a Jira ticket
Given the contex and the template write a Jira ticket (including the title):

CONTEXT:
Currently the business logic of the endopoints is entirely implemented in the definition of the endpoints.
This lead to have a lot of duplicate code and no separation of concerns.
To improve the maintanability of the application endpoints we should separe the business logic to `services` functions
that are gonna be used by the endpoints. We will have common service functions that can be reused by every endpoint and
specific funtions for the endpoint.
THis way would be also easir to manage multiple versions of the same endpoint in the future.

TEMPLATE:
**Problem**
Define the problem (what has happened and how does is it different from what you expected)

**Solution/experiment**
Describe the solution or experiment to resolve the problem

**Task breakdown (in hours)**
Break down the solution/experiment in small tasks inc. estimates in hours (2, 4, 8, 16)

**Validation tests (if needed)**
Include a list of tests (short description) to be created and validated before merging the PR related to this issue.

**Acceptance criteria**
